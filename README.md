# SELF demo scripts 

## Introduction

These sample scripts are a copy of the SELF API Server and meant to demonstrate the basic code for a standard implementation of SELF.
For the sake of simplicity we limited the demo scripts to just the elementary functionality.

All scripts have a .mjs extension.

A file with .mjs extension is a JavaScript source code file that is used as an ECMA Module (ECMAScript Module) in Node.js applications.
